## R CMD check results

This is a resubmission. The Windows build failed in the previous submission. 
The problematic code has now been replaced with a thread-safe approach using
a readersâ€“writer lock lock which should satisfy the Rust compiler being used for
Windows builds. Confirmed working with Win-builder.
